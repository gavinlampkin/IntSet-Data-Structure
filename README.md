# IntSet-Data-Structure
This project was completed while attending CS3358 with Dr. Koh in Fall 2023

Throughout this project, I learned more about how data manipulation works regarding dynamic data allocation using arrays.
As well as learning to troubleshoot data leaks throughout my development, I also became more aware of how to manipulate
and compare the data stored in these dynamic arrays.
